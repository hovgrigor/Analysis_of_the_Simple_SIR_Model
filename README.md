Infectious diseases are a prevalent issue among everyone. The knowledge of
its likely path and development can substantially help the government control the
disease and hospitals correctly manage resources to accommodate the high number
of patients. This is the aim of the SIR model, which this paper aims to explain and
provide examples of. The SIR model has many modifications and extensions, some
of which we will explore. We will also showcase and explain the analytic solution
to the standard SIR model, but unfortunately, many of the modifications do not
have an analytical solution; hence, we will approximate them numerically. The
main methods to do so will be the Euler and the backward Euler methods, both
of which have an error, which we will derive and showcase on graphs. All of the
coding is done in Python with examples and explanations, as well as graphs and
the explanation of the given graphs. Furthermore, we gathered and plotted graphs
from real-world data concerning some famous diseases. We will compare them to
the SIR model and determine how accurate it gets over time. Finally, we will draw
conclusions and discuss how much of an impact the model can have on the world
if used correctly.
